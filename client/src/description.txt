Hello! This is Raunak Chhatwal and I am in my final year at the University of South Florida in Tampa. My main specialization is in fullstack development (with a focus on backend development) with an ultimate career goal of becoming a systems engineer. For the past two Summers, I interned with GE Healthcare, about which you can navigate to my resume. My interests span a broad subsection of the software ecosystem, which I have detailed in this dynamic graph. Lastly, don't forget to check out the links on the top right of this page!

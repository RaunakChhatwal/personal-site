Hello! This is Raunak Chhatwal and I am in my final year at the University of South Florida in Tampa. My main specialization is in fullstack development (with a focus on backend development) with the ultimate career goal of becoming a systems engineer. For the past two Summers, I interned with GE Healthcare, about which you can navigate to my [resume](/resume). My [skills/interests](/interests) span a broad subsection of the software ecosystem.
